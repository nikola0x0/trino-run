# Task Completion Checklist

## Code Quality Checks
- **TypeScript**: No explicit TypeScript linting/formatting commands found in package.json
- **Build**: Run `npm run build` to ensure production build works
- **Development**: Test with `npm run dev` to verify hot reloading works

## Testing
- No test commands found in package.json
- No test files in project structure
- Manual testing required through development server

## Asset Management
- Verify assets are properly placed in `public/assets/`
- Ensure asset loading works in both dev and production builds
- Check that webpack copies assets to `dist/` folder correctly

## Browser Compatibility
- Babel targets browsers with >0.25% usage (excluding IE11 and Opera Mini)
- Test in supported browsers

## Notes
- This is a template project, so testing infrastructure may need to be added
- No linting tools (ESLint, TSLint) configured
- No formatting tools (Prettier) configured
- Consider adding these for production development
